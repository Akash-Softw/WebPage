<main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a vital practice in modern software development. It enables teams to deliver code changes frequently and reliably. Jenkins and Docker are two powerful tools that work together to streamline the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

    <h2>What is Jenkins?</h2>
    <p>Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying. It allows developers to integrate changes to the project more easily and deploy them to production more frequently.</p>

    <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
    <p>Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. This ensures that applications run consistently across different computing environments.</p>

    <h2>Integrating Jenkins with Docker</h2>
    <p>Integrating Jenkins with Docker allows you to build, test, and deploy your applications in isolated environments, making your CI/CD process more efficient and reliable.</p>
